<p>I am a cognitive scientist and recent graduate from the University of California, Berkeley, where I explored the intersection of brain science and artificial intelligence. During my time at UC Berkeley, I conducted research at the Computational Cognitive Science Lab, focusing on the capabilities of open-source models.</p>

<p>Currently, I am passionate about exploring the decision-making processes of artificial intelligence models and enhancing their capabilities. Iâ€™m also focused on expanding my skills in software engineering and data analytics. </p>

<p>Outside of academics, I enjoy photography, writing raps, and staying updated on the latest AI advancements through research papers.</p>
